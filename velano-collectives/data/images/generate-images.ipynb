    "### 1. Set up your OpenAI API Key\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\n",

    "```\n",

    "- **Product images**: `product_{id}_{name}.png` files\n",
    "- **Generation results**: `image_generation_results.json`\n",
    "- **Summary**: `image_generation_summary.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cost Considerations\n",
    "- DALL-E 3 costs $0.040 per image (1024×1024)\n",
    "- For 10 products = ~$0.40\n",
    "- Consider using DALL-E 2 for lower costs ($0.020 per image)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Customization Options\n",
    "- Modify the `create_image_prompt()` function to adjust image style\n",
    "- Change image size (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024)\n",
    "- Adjust quality settings (standard vs hd)\n",
    "- Add custom styling preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Error Handling\n",
    "The notebook includes comprehensive error handling and will continue processing even if some images fail to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Rate Limiting\n",
    "The notebook includes automatic delays between requests to respect OpenAI's rate limits."
